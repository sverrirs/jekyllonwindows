# UTF-8 Byte Order Marks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM (Byte order mark)</a> header characters are supported in Jekyll as of v3.1.1. The only thing needed is to explicitly specifying bom with the encoding in your `_config.yml`

```
encoding: bom|utf-8
```

Despite [BOM issues](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2853) being [fixed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/4404) starting in Jekyll v3.1.1, there still may be [issues with the BOM in certain cases](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5363) so for the time being removing the BOM characters from files may be a more reliable solution.


# Set your encoding to UTF-8
Depending on the version of Ruby and/or Jekyll you’re using, your site’s content, and maybe other factors, you may need to make sure Jekyll will read your site’s source as UTF-8.

Add the following line to your `_config.yml` file

```
encoding: utf-8
```

# Use subfolders
Jekyll cannot build or serve sites from certain system-reserved folders on Windows, like your user folder. Instead, it will output an error looking like this:

```
C:\Users\You>jekyll serve
Configuration file: C:\Users\You\_config.yml
            Source: C:\Users\You
       Destination: C:\Users\You\_site
      Generating...
jekyll 2.4.0 | Error: Permission denied - .
```

If you encounter such an error, simply move your site to a subdirectory (e.g., `C:\Users\You\awesome-jekyll-site`) and try again.

# Ensure that the Ruby DevKit is the correct bit version
While executing the install commands for the native extensions, such as the `wdm` gem an error message such as this might appear

```
ruby.exe -r ./siteconf20170127-20196-ups7xn.rb extconf.rb
checking for main() in -lkernel32... *** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
```

As reported by [Mike Lloyd (@mxplusb)](https://github.com/mxplusb) one solution is to ensure that you installed the bit version (32 or 64 bit) of the DevKit that matches your operating system.

# The End

```
jekyll build
jekyll build --watch
jekyll build -w
jekyll serve
jekyll serve --watch
jekyll serve -w
```

You can now run all of the above commands on your Windows machine. Congratulations! You have successfully set up Jekyll on Windows.
