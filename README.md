# How to run Jekyll 3 on Windows
Installing Jekyll 3 on Windows machines is not as simple as for Linux or OSX. We to have an excellent guide written by [Julian Thilo](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com) on how to install Jekyll v2.x but it has not been updated to cover Jekyll v3.x.

Unfortunately there is a lot of breaking changes between Jekyll v2.x and v3.x but don't worry, this guide is here to help!
